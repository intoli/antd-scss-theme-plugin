`antd-scss-theme-plugin` is a [Webpack plugin](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/) which allows you to effectively use [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) in a project with SCSS styling.
With it you can:

1. Customize Ant Design by specifying theme variable overrides through a single `theme.scss` file.
2. `@import` Ant Design's [theme](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less) and [color](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/color/colors.less) variables from your `theme.scss` file.
3. Hot reload your project when `theme.scss` changes.

:book: For a more detailed overview of the plugin and its usage, check out the [Using Ant Design in Sass-Styled Projects](https://intoli.com/blog/antd-scss-theme-plugin/) article on [Intoli's blog](https://intoli.com/blog/).

## Installation

This plugin is published as [antd-scss-theme-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antd-scss-theme-plugin) on `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev antd-scss-theme-plugin
```

It extends the functionality of a `antd`, `less-loader` and `sass-loader` to accomplish its goals.
These are listed as `peerDependencies` in [package.json](package.json), and you can install them with:

```
npm install --save antd
npm install --save-dev less-loader sass-loader
```


## Configuration

To use `antd-scss-theme-plugin`, you need to configure Ant Design to use Less stylesheets when loading components, and to connect a few loaders with the plugin in your Webpack setup.
You can find a fully configured project in the [example](example/) directory.


### Step 1. Configure Ant Design to Use Less Stylesheets

In order to customize Ant Design's theme, you need to configure `antd` to load its components with Less stylesheets instead of with pre-compiled CSS.
The [official documentation](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme) explains this to some degree, but here are the explicit steps you should take.

1. Install [babel-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-import), a package published by the makers of `antd`.
2. Modify the plugin section of your Babel setup to use this package with `antd`:

    ```json
    "plugins": [
      ["import", {
        "libraryName": "antd",
        "style": true
      }]
    ]
    ```

    The `"style": true` option is what enables the use of Less components.
3. Configure `less-loader` to compile `antd` components.
    This can be done by adding something like the following to your Webpack config's `loaders` array:

    ```javascript
    {
      test: /\.less$/,
      use: [
        'style-loader',
        {
          loader: 'css-loader',
          options: {
            importLoaders: 1,
            sourceMap: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
          },
        },
        'less-loader',
      ],
    }
    ```

    Obviously, this also requires you to install `style-loader` and `css-loader`.

With that setup, you can import self-contained `antd` components with lines like following:

```javascript
import { Button } from 'antd';
```

So, in addition to enabling styling customizations, this has the potential to reduce the size of your Webpack bundle.


### Step 2. Use `antd-scss-theme-plugin` in Your Webpack Setup

First, initialize the plugin by passing your theme file's path to the plugin's constructor, and add the plugin to your Webpack config's `plugins` array:

```javascript
import AntdScssThemePlugin from 'antd-scss-theme-plugin';
import path from 'path';

const webpackConfig =  {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new AntdScssThemePlugin(path.resolve('./theme.scss')),
  ],
};
```

Second, wrap your `less-loader` and `sass-loader` Webpack configs with `AntdScssThemeFile.themify()`.
For example, in the config from Step 1, you would change the line

```javascript
'less-loader',
```

to

```javascript
AntdScssThemePlugin.themify('less-loader'),
```

This works even when your loader has options, e.g., you would change

```javascript
{
  loader: 'sass-loader',
  options: {
    sourceMap: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  },
}
```

to

```javascript
AntdScssThemePlugin.themify({
  loader: 'sass-loader',
  options: {
    sourceMap: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  },
})
```


## Usage

### Customize Ant Design's Theme

With the project configured, you can customize Ant Design's theme by specifying [Ant Design theme variables](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less) in your SCSS theme file (e.g., `theme.scss`).
For example, if `theme.scss` has the following contents

```scss
/* theme.scss */
$primary-color: #fe8019;
```

then the interface will no longer be based off of the default blue `#1890ff`, but rather a louder orange `#fe8019`:

![Effects of Changing Primary Color to #fe8019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intoli/antd-scss-theme-plugin/master/resources/blue-orange-comparison.png)

You can customize any Less variable that `antd` uses in this way: just relace `@` with a `$`, e.g., `@info-color` becomes `$info-color`.


### Use Ant Design's Customized Color and Theme Variables

Importing `theme.scss` in some SCSS file gives it access all of Ant Design's [theme](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less) and [color](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/color/colors.less) variables.
This is true even if you specify only a subset of the available theme variables in `theme.scss`.
For instance, with `theme.scss` containing only a `$primary-color` definition as above, you would still be able to do something like:

```scss
@import '../theme.scss';

.header {
  color: $blue-10; /* From colors.less */
  padding: $padding-lg; /* From themes/default.less */
}
```


### Live Reload Components when Ant Design Styles Change

Since `antd-scss-theme-plugin` registers your theme file as a watched dependency with Webpack, changes in the theme file will result in recompilations of components that use it.
To learn how to set up your project to use live reloading, see the working [example](example/).
